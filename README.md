 📰 Fake News Headline Generator

A fun Python project that generates random, hilarious, and absurd fake news headlines using a combination of subjects, actions, and places/things.

 🚀 Features

* Randomly generates fake news headlines.
* Interactive loop – ask the user if they want another headline.
* Endless fun with funny and unpredictable combinations.

 🛠️ How It Works

1. The program stores lists of **subjects**, **actions**, and **places/things**.
2. On each run, it randomly picks one element from each list.
3. Combines them into a fake headline with the format:


BREAKING NEWS: <subject> <action> <place/thing>


4. Asks the user if they want another headline (`yes/no`).



📂 Example Output

BREAKING NEWS: Virat kohli eats at Ganga ghat

Do you want another headline? (yes/no) yes

BREAKING NEWS: A Mumbai cat declares war on inside parliament

Do you want another headline? (yes/no) no

Thanks for using the Fake News Headline Generator. Have a fun day
